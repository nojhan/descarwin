  ______________________________________________________________________________

  v1.4: 2006.06.22
	- !!!: Sorry, this version is *not* fully-source-compatible with 
	       previous ones (see below).

	- FIX: gdsl_perm_canonical_cycles_count returned wrong number of cycles.
	- FIX: compiles now under OSX with the patch from Martin Pichlmair.
	- FIX: compilation warning removed.
	- FIX: gdsl_stack_insert was wrong.
	- FIX: types fixed in bstree & rbtree modules.
	- FIX: a '>' was missing in list xml output.

	- ADD: heap module added.

	- CHG: GDSL project has moved from savannah to gna!
	- CHG: all high-level modules are now using same gdsl_map_func_t and 
	       gdsl_write_func_t, for mapping and writing data structures. 
	       These functions types have now an additional gdsl_location_t argument
	       that make this version not fully compatible with previous version.

  v1.3: 2004.04.10 
        - !!!: Sorry, this version is *not* fully-source-compatible with 
	       previous ones (see below).

        - FIX: search functions in hash module. 
        - FIX: backward parse function in list module.
	- FIX: removed usefull comparison in list module's search function.
	- FIX: XML output formats of tree modules.
	- FIX: incorrect proto in list module.
	- FIX: incorrect proto in hash module.
	- FIX: insert function in bstree module.
	- FIX: set_name function in rbtree module.

        - ADD: general hash function.
        - ADD: general sort function.
	- ADD: function to get the cardinality of a low-level list.
        - ADD: function for sorting lists.
	- ADD: enable/disable asserts directives in configure script.
	- ADD: functions into the perm module.
 	- ADD: functions to insert not found searched elements in trees modules.
	- ADD: function to search next element in a bstree.
        - ADD: gdsl.spec file to generate RPM package.
	- ADD: new functions into some modules.
        - ADD: THANKS file.

        - CHG: removed usefull internal memory module.
        - CHG: some recursive functions has been rewritten in iteratives 
               forms to improve speed.
	- CHG: canonical functions in permutation module are now in D. Knuth's
               canonical form.
	- CHG: a lot of protos and functions names has been modified in almost 
               all modules to improve acuracy and homogeneousness of symbol 
               names, so THIS VERSION IS *NOT* COMPATIBLE WHITH PREVIOUS ONE.
	- CHG: the heap module was removed and may be reintroduced in a future 
               version with a lot of functions. The sort function has been 
               moved to the new gdsl_sort module.
	- CHG: the _list_node module has been renamed _node and so, all its 
               symbol names have been changed.
	- CHG: man and html doxygen-generated documentation
